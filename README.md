1. Go to your Joomla Admin Plugin Manager, and search for `Captcha - ReCaptcha`, Open/ Edit the plugin and fill up 
the settings and save it.
2. After that Go to the Joomla! `Global Configuration` and under `Site` tab there is an option called `Default Captcha `
Set that to `Captcha - ReCaptcha` and save.
